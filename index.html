                    <p>
                        In April 2013 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ava66/has_anyone_ever_made_a_graph_of_how_all_the/">I posed the question</a>: has anyone ever tried to perform social network analysis on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> by visualising the links between different subreddits? As you can see from the discussion on that page, several other attempts have also been made at answering this question, mainly by using sidebar links to define connections between subreddits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are my attempts at creating an interactive map of Reddit:
                    </p>
                    <h2>Vizit</h2>
                    <div class="preview">
                        <a href="/sna/vizit">
                            <img class="bottom shadow" src="img/vizit-megaman.png" alt="Go to Vizit" title="Go to Vizit" />
                            <img class="top shadow" src="img/vizit-preview.png" alt="Go to Vizit" title="Go to Vizit" />
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        After creating my original self-post map (see below) I was unsatisfied with how little of Reddit was represented in this dataset. To that end I created a new dataset, this time defining links by the number of times subreddits contain links to the same websites (so not just other sections of reddit). This dataset was much larger, so I had to make the visualisation more interactive to allow you to hide parts of the network in order to focus on the bits you care about. <a href="/sna/vizit">Click here to try it out</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Offshoots</h3>
                    <p>
                        You may also want to check out Rhiever&apos;s <a href="http://rhiever.github.io/redditviz/">redditviz</a> site. This uses the vizit code to visualise a slightly different dataset comprising link submissions, self-posts, and comments on reddit. Check out the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3387">research paper</a> by Michigan State University if you'd like to know how the dataset was produced.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Self-post map</h2>
                    <div class="preview">
                        <a href="/sna/selfposts.html">
                            <img class="shadow" src="img/selfpost-preview.png" alt="Click for an interactive version" title="Click for an interactive version" />
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This was my first attempt at mapping the relationships between subreddits, with associations defined by a redditor posting a link to one subreddit in another subreddit. In order to make the map usable, I had to remove a lot of data (which is why many subs are missing). This work has largely been superseded by <a href="/sna/vizit">Vizit</a> now, but I've left <a href="/sna/selfposts.html">here</a> for reference, due to the media interest it received.
